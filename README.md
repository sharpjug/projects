Projects I made so far are uploaded apart from main game automation since it's too large of a file.

Working on:
- Using Unity to make a simple Flappy Bird game

Future projects:
- A basic blog page
- Using Python to create a basic image editor ( Such as increasing the saturation of a photo )
- Fully designing, and implementing two mobile games that I have in mind
- A copy of a media platform to further improve my web development skills
