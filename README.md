Projects I made so far are uploaded apart from main game automation since it's too large of a file.
Working on:
- Using Unity to make simple flappybird game

Future projects:
- A basic blog page
- Using python to create a basic image editor ( Such as increasing saturation of a photo )
- Fully designing, implementing, and releasing two mobile games that I have in mind
    - Create a basic developer log page if the games become popular
- A copy of a media platform to further improve my web development skills
